Security violation when some principal different from admin was trying to remove privileges from admin.
According to specification: "No special permission is needed if the current principal is p: any non-admin principal can always deny himself rights" and here we deny admin rights.

It contains 3 programs which in principle do the following:
1. We set the default delegator to admin, so any new principal has the same permissions. We create a new principal p and a new variable x.
2. As principal p we remove from admin the read privileges on the variable x.
3. As principal admin we create a new principal q and give it read privilege on x.
