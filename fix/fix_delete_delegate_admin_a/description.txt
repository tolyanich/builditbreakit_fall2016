The bug in break submission 30611 rised from incorrect understanding of spec about delete delegation. Spec says:
"Security violation unless the current principal is admin, p, or q; if the principal is q and <tgt> is a variable x, then it must have delegate permission on x. (No special permission is needed if the current principal is p: any NON-ADMIN principal can always deny himself rights)."

So we add special check in delete delegation code:
"
//can't remove permission from admin
if targetUser == adminUsername {
   return ErrFailed
}
"
This fix we removes this code.
