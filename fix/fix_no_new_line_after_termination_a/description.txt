Submission 27920 bug.
Go's implementation of line split func expects new line symbol or EOF when reading input data. Since reading is performed from the socket it will continue until new line symbol will come or the socket is closed. Explicit check of termination sequence in the input solves this problem. Of course this sequence can occur in the other command, but grammar forbids it and the error will be returned when parsing.
