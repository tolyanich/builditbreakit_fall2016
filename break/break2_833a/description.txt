The system allow to update variable for users who don't have write access to that variable if default delegator have write access to this variable. Default delegator delegates rights only on newly created principal. If principal created before  default delegator set, that principal should not have any change in permission. From SPEC:
Sets the “default delegator” to p. This means that when a principal q is created, the system automatically delegates all from p to q. Changing the default delegator does not affect the permissions of existing principals. The initial default delegator is anyone.
